# 🚀 Next.js for Drupal multilingual template by Wunder

This is a starter template created by [Wunder](https://www.wunder.io) for a decoupled website using the open-source [Next.js for Drupal](https://next-drupal.org/) project by [Chapter Three](https://www.chapterthree.com) and contributors.

> ⚠️⚠️ **Now using the App router in Next.js!** 🎉 If you prefer using the pages router, we have kept the old version in the `pages-router` branch.

## 🪂 Check out the running demo at https://next-drupal-starterkit.dev.wdr.io !

The aims of this template are:

- automating local environment set up as much as possible, lowering the effort needed to get the decoupled system working
- presenting simple solutions for the most common feature requests for a Drupal site
- focusing on the multilingual aspect which presents interesting challenges, and is a very common requirement in our projects.

Setting up [Next.js for Drupal](https://next-drupal.org/) normally requires various steps, in this template we have
automated them using a combination of environment variables and the upcoming [Distributions and Recipes](https://www.drupal.org/about/core/strategic-initiatives-distributions-and-recipes) initiative on the Drupal side.

The template includes all you need to have a working multi-language decoupled Drupal and Next.js site up and running in seconds, complete with demo content, an Elasticsearch-powered search interface, and more. Check the [what's included section ↘️](#-whats-included) for more details.

This example is meant to be used together with the [Silta](https://wunderio.github.io/silta/) hosting system by [Wunder](https://www.wunder.io), but it can be used with any hosting system.

## 🤓 Lando or DDEV? Your choice!

This starterkit can be used either with [Lando](https://lando.dev/) or with [DDEV](https://www.DDEV.com/). The only requirement is to have either one of those installed.

### Lando minimum version

The minimum version of lando required is 3.21.

> Check the `version` property in the `.lando.yml` file to see which version of Lando is currently supported.

### ⚠️⚠️ NOTE: Using npm

Instead of running npm operations in your host machine, _this template requires you to use npm inside Lando or DDEV_: this ensures the same node version is used by all developers participating in the project, and also that the node process has the right environment variables to connect to the backend without the need of additional configuration steps.

**Just prefix all npm operations with `lando` or `ddev`.**

So instead of `npm install`, run `lando npm install` or `ddev npm install`, instead of `npm run dev` run `lando npm run dev` or `ddev npm run dev`, etc.

> ⚠️⚠️ For DDEV, when using npm commands you have to make sure that you are in the `next` directory.

#### Stopping a running npm operation running inside the Lando node container

If you have closed the terminal window where you were running the server with `lando npm start` or `lando npm run dev`, and you want to stop the running npm operation, you can use the specially created `lando npm-stop` command that will log into the node container and kill all node processes there.

## 🤸 Getting started

Follow this guide to get the backend and frontend up and running. You can either do it all in one go, or step by step to understand better what's going on.

### 🏎️ Quickstart

1. Clone this repository
2. Choose which local environment you want to use: **Lando** or **DDEV**.
3. Run the setup script corresponding to your chosen local environment:

```bash
./setup-lando.sh
```

or

```bash
./setup-ddev.sh
```

The script will execute a series of commands in sequence. If an error occurs, you can run the script again, and it will pick up where it left off.

If the script has failed on some step, and instead of continuing you want to start from scratch, you can run the script with the `-c` flag:

```bash
./setup-[lando/ddev].sh -c
```

> NOTE: the script will install the site from scratch. Export your database if you have started working with the template, and you have something valuable in it. :)

## 👨‍💻Urls

After the setup is complete, you can access the site at the following URLs:

### With Lando

Lando has two separate containers for the backend and frontend, so the URLs are different:

| Backend                                   | Frontend                    |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| https://next-drupal-starterkit.lndo.site/ | https://frontend.lndo.site/ |

You can get a more detailed list of all the services and their urls with the command:

```bash
lando info
```

### With DDEV

DDEV has a single container for both the backend and frontend, so the URLs differ only by the port:

| Backend                                  | Frontend                   |
| ---------------------------------------- |----------------------------|
| https://next-drupal-starterkit.ddev.site | https://frontend.ddev.site |

> NOTE: localhost:3000 does not work in DDEV, you need to use the URL provided by DDEV above.

You can get a more detailed list of all the services and their urls with the command:

```bash
ddev describe
```

## 📦 What's included?

We try to add to the template what we think are the most commonly requested features in website projects. Most of these are based on the features provided by [Next.js for Drupal](https://next-drupal.org/), but we have paid special attention to making these work in a multilanguage setup.

### Draft mode

The template is set up to allow editors to use [Draft mode](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/draft-mode). Visit the node page on the Drupal side while the frontend is running to see a preview of the page. This works also for unpublished content, and for draft revisions.

### Drupal preview

You can preview changes to a piece of content, or even a completely new piece of content before saving it the first time. Use the usual preview button in the Drupal backend to see the changes in the frontend.

### On-demand revalidation

The template includes [On demand revalidation](https://next-drupal.org/learn/on-demand-revalidation), when saving or editing a piece of content the corresponding page in the frontend will be recreated. Because the frontpage in this example site includes a list of articles, the frontpage paths have been manually added to the configuration for the article content type.

### Metatag support

The template includes basic metatag support. Default metatag values are added to the frontend site's translation files, and content-based metatags are added to the Drupal backend using the [Metatag](https://www.drupal.org/project/metatag) module.
The Next.js site will then create the metatags using a combination of these two data sources.

### Search indexing and frontend search interface

The site is set up to work with Elasticsearch to provide a complete search experience.
Both the Lando and DDEV setups include spinning up an Elasticsearch instance with the required plugins. The content normalization and index handling is managed via the custom `wunder_search` module, which in turn makes use of the [Elasticsearch helper Drupal contrib module](https://www.drupal.org/project/elasticsearch_helper).
On the frontend side, the search user uses the [Elastic UI library](https://elastic.github.io/eui/).
The frontend site queries Elasticsearch via a simple proxy controller in Drupal, also provided by the included `wunder_search` custom Drupal module.
The included frontend search UI is provided by [Searchkit](https://www.searchkit.co/).

### Importable demo content

The template includes a Drupal migration to populate the site with a set of translated demo content and some test users. This includes paragraphs, images, videos, etc. Most of the content has been generated by AI.

### Multilanguage setup

This template is set up to use three languages: English (default), Finnish, and Swedish. These languages are added in Drupal using the standard translation modules and integrated into the frontend using the [Next-Intl](https://next-intl-docs.vercel.app/) module.
The Elasticsearch indexing takes the content language into account for analysis, and the interface is fully translated. (Note: Most translations were done using Google Translate, so please expect some inaccuracies in Finnish, Swedish, and even English. 🙂)

### Webforms

The Drupal setup includes the popular [Webform](https://www.drupal.org/project/webform) module. The frontpage on the frontend displays a form that will post data back to Drupal's webform, with basic validation and a feedback message.
We decided to implement a static form, in the sense that the "hardcoded" fields in the frontend need to match the fields in the webform in the backend. Creating a dynamic system of forms that automatically match what's coming from the user-defined webforms in Drupal is out of scope for this template.

### Drupal Paragraphs (including nested paragraphs)

The `frontpage` and `page` content types are configured to use the popular [Paragraphs drupal module](https://www.drupal.org/project/paragraphs). The setup includes basic paragraph types to add images, videos, text, and also a nested paragraph type to demonstrate how to handle this in backend and frontend.

### Retrying of failed requests

If the backend is not available momentarily, the frontend will try again to call it before returning an error.

### Frontend user authentication and registration

The template includes the setup to allow users to log into the Drupal backend from the Next.js frontend, using [Auth.js](https://authjs.dev/).

- As an example, only registered users are allowed to post to the drupal `contact` webform, and parts of the interface in the frontend are available only for logged-in users.
- Some test users are imported as part of the content migration (check the `users.csv' file for the credentials).
- New users can be created on the frontend using a simple registration form. Drupal will assign them the correct role, and will send them an email with the link to set their password.

### Typescript

The frontend uses [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) to provide type safety.

TypeScript is setup quite loosely by default to minimise friction and make it accessible to developers who are not familiar with it. It is recommended to increase type safety by enabling some of the disabled rules in `next/eslint.json`.

#### Working with GraphQL and TypeScript

The project uses GraphQL to fetch data from the backend. The queries are defined in the `next/lib/graphql` directory. The queries are typed using the `graphql-codegen` package, which generates TypeScript types from the queries. The types are then used to type the data fetched from the backend.

When adding or modifying queries and fragments, the codegen script needs to be run to generate the corresponding types from the schema. Though you can always run `lando npm run graphql-codegen` or `ddev npm run graphql-codegen` yourself if needed, you shouldn't normally need to: `lando npm run build` or `ddev npm run build` will run the codegen before the build, and `lando npm run dev` or `ddev npm run dev` will start the codegen in watch mode alongside starting Next.js in development mode. The output of the codegen is gitignored, as the same step will be run on the CI server.

Note that when there are changes on the GraphQL server schema itself, you will need to stop and start the command again to fetch the new schema definition (it will keep watching your changed files, but will only re-fetch the schema from the server when the codegen command first runs). Also, you might need to run `lando drush cr` or `ddev drush cr` to clear the Drupal cache.

##### VSCode extensions to work with GraphQL and TypeScript

We have included a `.vscode/extensions.json` file that will suggest some useful extensions to work with GraphQL and TypeScript in VSCode with full autocomplete and syntax highlighting. You can install them by clicking on the notification that appears when you open the project in VSCode.

Please note:
1. We suggest opening the project in VSCode using the `/next` directory as the root of the project. 
2. The latest version of the "GraphQL: Language Feature Support" extension [currently has a bug](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/issues/3620) that prevents it from working correctly with the `graphql-codegen` package. Make sure to install the v0.9.3 version instead.

#### Typesafe environment variables

The environment variables used by the frontend are also checked for type safety. If used correctly, a Zod error will prevent the frontend from building if the environment variables are not set according to the schema defined in `next/env.ts`. 

To add a new environment variable:
1. Add it to `.lando.yml`, under services > node > overrides > environment. or to `.ddev/config.yaml` for DDEV.
2. Add it to `next/env.ts`. Note that it must be added twice there - once under server/client to define its schema, and once under `runtimeEnv` to read the actual value.
3. Import it in the file where it's used with `import { env } from "@/env";` and use it like `env.MY_ENV_VAR`. At this point, your environment variable should be working locally.
4. To ensure it also works in CircleCI and Silta, also add it to`.circleci/config.yml` and `silta-next.yml`.

#### XML sitemap

The Next.js frontend will query the Drupal backend to generate a `/sitemap.xml` path that can be submitted to search engines.

### Testing with Cypress (Lando only)

The template includes example tests to be run with Cypress. The Lando setup includes a headless browser and Cypress, so you can run the tests locally without the need to install anything else, but it won't be able to use the visual Cypress application. See below for more details.

#### Running tests locally inside Lando on the command line

To run the Cypress tests inside Lando:

1. make sure the backend is running
2. run `lando npm run build` to build the frontend
3. run `lando npm run start` to start serving the frontend
4. open another terminal and run `lando npm run cypress:run` to start the Cypress test runner

A video of the run will be recorded, and it will be available at `next/cypress/videos`.

#### Using the Cypress application

If you want to run the visual Cypress application, you will need to run cypress outside of Lando, on your host computer. For this to work:

1. ensure you are using the correct node version, matching what we use inside Lando (see the `.lando.yml` file for details)
2. ensure your machine has the correct dependencies installed (see the [Cypress docs](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress#System-requirements) for details)
3. check which version of Cypress is specified in `next/package.json` and install the same version on your host computer globally with `npm install -g cypress@<version>`
4. while in the `/next` directory, run `npm run cypress:open` (notice that there's no `lando` at the beginning of the command).

You can then run your tests inside the Cypress application.

#### Redis caching

The project is set up to use [Redis](https://redis.io/) if available to cache the responses from the backend. Both the ddev and lando setup include redis by default.
The connection between next.js and redis is handled by the [@neshca/cache-handler](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@neshca/cache-handler) package.

### Connecting to Redis in the local environment

You can connect to Redis and interact with it using the [redis cli](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/connect/cli/) in the local environment by running the following command:

If you are using Lando:

```bash
lando redis-cli
```

If you are using DDEV:

```bash
ddev redis
```
